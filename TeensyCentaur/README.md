# Teensy Centaur

Thi folder contains an implementation of the Centaur model
targetted for the Teensy microcontroller. This project is
created and built using
[VisualTeensy](https://github.com/luni64/VisualTeensy)
and [TyCommander](https://github.com/Koromix/tytools).
Unfortunately, VisualTeensy currently only supports Windows
usage.

For information on setting up your Teensy to be used as
a guitar pedal-style effect see [here](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/courses/250a-winter-2020/labs/2/).
Note that you will need the Teensy, as well as Teensy Audio Shield.
